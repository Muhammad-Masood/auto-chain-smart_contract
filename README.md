## Auto Chain

Auto chain is a system that tracks the entire lifecycle of a car, from its production in the factory to its end of life and disposal or recycling. This concept involves using blockchain technology to create a transparent and secure record of each vehicle's history and condition. It could include details like manufacturing, maintenance, repairs, ownership changes, and eventual dismantling or recycling. This approach could significantly enhance the transparency and reliability of vehicle information, benefiting both consumers and businesses.

Token Type: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will represent each vehicle.

Supply and Issuance: A dynamic issuance model where new tokens are created as new cars are added, and tokens are retired when cars are withdrawn.

Token Utility: Tokens will be used to access detailed information about each car, including rental history, maintenance received, locations visited, and ownership details.

    1. **Renting the Car**: The smart contract will have functions to manage rental agreements, including setting rental terms, durations, and prices. Renters can engage these functions to initiate and complete rental transactions.
    
    2. **Maintenance Updates**: The smart contract will allow for updates on maintenance. Owners can input details of various maintenance activities, such as:
    - Servicing and repairs performed.
    - Parts replaced or upgraded.
    - Regular maintenance checks.
    - Any significant modifications or restorations.

Integration with Smart Contracts: Smart contracts on BSC will manage vehicle rentals, updates on maintenance, and transfer of ownership.

Reward Mechanisms: Ideas include loyalty programs for frequent renters, incentives for responsible maintenance, rewards for safety inspections and updates, and benefits for customer referrals or reviews.
